# Bzoj Mover

This project aims to provide a quick way to port problems in bzoj to uoj **if you have datasets**.

#### How to port data (useless in fact)

Put 'data.cpp' in the same directory with the datasets. Compile it and upload ported 'uoj_data' directly.

#### How to port problem statement

Put 'bzojch-master' directory in the same directory with the 'statement.cpp'.
